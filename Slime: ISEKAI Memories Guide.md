# Slime-ISEKAI-Memories-Guide
An unofficial guide for the game Slime: ISEKAI Memories
[Slime: ISEKAI Memories] is a 3d battle RPG game for mobile adapted from the anime [That time I got reincarnated as a Slime]
I made this simple (but messy and stupid) guide because I thought it can help other people playing the game (And I was bored). This also isn't technically a beginner guide since this only talks about magicrystals, recruit tickets, raising ep, getting magiblocks, magicules, gold coins, and completing event and event quests.
Let's Start!

1. How do I earn more magicrystals?

 - Completing the daily quest: Completing the 5 daily tasks will give you 15x Magicrystals.
 
 - Maxing out all levels (Getting 3 stars on all Levels): Getting 3 stars on a Level will give you 3x-5x Magicrystals.
 
 - Interact with characters: There are 2 ways to do this; Talking to them in your town or Giving them gifts. Talking to characters, accepting their requests, and giving them gifts will raise the bond level. You get 5x Magicrystals every level you pass so make sure to talk to them and give them gifts!
 
 - Event (Ends in Nov 30): Completing the stage "Observation Journal" daily will give you 1x recruit ticket for the Veldora Banner. Don't miss out!
 
 - (This is obvious but...) Daily Login: The Daily Login Bonus gives you 30x Magicrystals every week (Day 7) so make sure to login daily!
 
2. How to increase a character's ep?

  - Magicules: Always make sure to max out your character's level. You can get more Magicules from [Magicules Quest].
  
  - Memory Stones (Obtained from Gacha): Memory Stones can [Awaken] your character and raise their level limit. Make sure to save those Memory Stones for the future!
  
  - Ability Release: Using Magirocks to do [Ability Release] will increase your defense, attack, health, etc. You can get Magirocks from [Ability Release Quest]. Make sure to use [Parallel Processing] before you go to bed so when login, you get many Magirocks and you can use [Ability Release] more.
  
  - Skills: Using empowerment (Predator Skills) will increase your character's skill level. Completing [Predator Quest] will help you get more Predator Skills.
  
  - Equipment: Using the right equipment for your character can significantly increase it's attack, defense, and health. Make sure to equip THE RIGHT WEAPON BASED ON THE CHARACTER'S WEAPON SPECIALTY (e.g. Short Sword, Fists, etc.). And also make sure to Level up and Evolve your equipment to get the best out of them.
  
  
  Random Tips:
  1. ALWAYS make sure that you have something building in your town and ALWAYS use the [Request Aid] feature. Doing these will make your town building more efficient.
  
  2. Complete the [Beginner Bingo] to get Memory Stones to upgrade Shuna to a 6 star.
  
  3. (For the event) Buy all the [Butler's House] blueprints to build more of them and increase your population.
  
  4. (For the event) Complete the [Event Bingo] to get Memory Stones to upgrade [Crimson Ogre Warrior] Benimaru to a 6 star.
  
  5. (For the event) I HIGHLY recommend that you use an all DARK type party because DARK type characters have special effects [Bonus Drops] on the event.
  
  6. (For the event) I recommend that you farm [The Serious Orc and the Forest Manager (Expert)]
